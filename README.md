# Chorus Go-gRPC-Client

[![godocs.io](https://godocs.io/github.com/third-light/go-grpc-client?status.svg)](https://godocs.io/github.com/third-light/go-grpc-client)

This is the official Go gRPC client package for the Chorus Public API from [Third Light](https://thirdlight.com).

It provides a friendly wrapper around the client generated from
our API protobuf definitions. It serves to make Chorus more
accessible to those interested in developing integrations.

An example client application can be found under `cmd/example`.
